        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a junior majoring in Computer and Information Science and minoring in Business Administration at Berea
            College, KY. As an eager and adaptable person, I have always been studying far from home and what was common
            was that I always thrived no matter where I go or what I did. I am constantly learning new technical and interpersonal skills.
            <br>I am serving as Residence Advisor for Dana Residence Hall in Berea College. In this job, I learned what
            and how to work in a team to be successful. Currently,I bought a course on Udemy called "100 days of coding: The complete python bootcamp". This course is making me more confident with my coding skills.
            <br>I am passionate about Software development, Data Analysis and entrepreneurship. Right now, I am looking for
            opportunities that I can use my skills to help others.
